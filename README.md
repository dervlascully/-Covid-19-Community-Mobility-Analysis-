# Covid-19-Community-Mobility-Analysis-
__Time-series analysis of the Google Community Mobility Reports.__

Project for the module __COMP30760 Data Science in Python__

In 2020 __Google__ released a set of __Community Mobility Reports__ (GCMR). These reports are based on the company’s location-tracking capabilities and measure changes in mobility with respect to a baseline for __Retail & Recreation, Grocery & Pharmacy, Workplaces, Transit Stations, Residential and Parks__. The dataset provides data on visitor numbers (or duration for the residential category) to for these categories of location each day with respect to the baseline. This provide insight into how peoples’ movements have changed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. 

For this project I have chosen 3 countries, and will start by analysing each of the categories, and comparing various different categories, for each of the countries individually. I will then analyse and compare each of the categories for the 3 different countries. I will look at the distributions, trends, means, standard deviations, maxima and minima.

The 3 countries which I have chosen for my analysis are __Ireland, New Zealand and the United States__.
